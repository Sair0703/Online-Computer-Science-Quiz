This is a short quiz that I created for everyone regardless of age or knowledge to play. This is a computer science quiz designed to test the knowledge of the topic with five simple questions.
The quiz has a introduction and a start quiz button that after clicking, gives instructions on how to complete it and how much time you will have for each question.
The quiz was created using the combination of Javascript, HTML, and CSS to give the client and the creator easy access and easy to understand and do this quiz.
